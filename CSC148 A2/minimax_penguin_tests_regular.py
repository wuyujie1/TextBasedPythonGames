TODO: Read the following docstring before clicking 'run'
This unittest is an unofficial unittests provided by Penguin, which makes its
quality heavuly depend on how Penguin did on this assignment(I personally think
I have done a great job, by the way).
This unittests
will compare your results againsts Penguin's result. If you pass it, don't be
happy, it's highly likely that Penguin happenly made the same mistake as you
made. If you did't pass it, don't be panic because Penguin did't sleep well
last night due to his roommates playing Overwatch loudly until 1 a.m.

Don't bother to try reversing enginerring this script since it doesn't contain
even one line of Penguin's minimax code.

Please report any issue to will.qie@mail.utoronto.ca so we can improve out code
together.

TODO: Put the *_results and this file in the same directory as your code
Note that The tests finishes in 48s on a i7 computer.
