TODO: Read the following docstring before you click 'run' and fail all the tests
This unittest is an unofficial unittests provided by Penguin, which makes its
quality heavuly depend on how Penguin did on this assignment(I personally think
I have done a great job, by the way).
This unittests
will compare your results againsts Penguin's result. If you pass it, don't be
happy, it's highly likely that Penguin happenly made the same mistake as you
made. If you did't pass it, don't be panic because Penguin did't sleep well
last night due to his roommate playing Overwatch loudly until 1 a.m.

Don't bother to try reversing enginerring this script since it doesn't contain
even one line of Penguin's minimax code.

Please report any issue to will.qie@mail.utoronto.ca so we can improve out code
together.

TODO: Config your minimax as instructed below to cope with this tests file.
Configuration instructions:
Please modify your code slightly in such a way that your minimax function will
out put a dictionary in which the keys are the moves and the values are the
score of the move accordingly.
For example: if we call minimax on a subtractsquare game in which it's p1 to
make a move and the current total is 5. In this case, the out put should be
{1: -1, 4: -1}

TODO: Put the my_results and this file in the same directory as your code
